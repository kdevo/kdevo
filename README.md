I am a free-minded and passionate software engineer, tech enthusiast and maker from Aachen.

In [my bachelor thesis](https://kdevo.dev/#bachelor-thesis) from 2018, I examined how well [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) can be integrated into existing business processes of the [FH Aachen](https://www.fh-aachen.de/).
By the start of 2020, I extensively explored the data science field and got fascinated by machine learning projects that improve human interaction.
I recently completed my Master of Engineering in [Information Systems Engineering](https://fhac.de/ise) where I took a deep dive into the emerging field of Reciprocal Recommender Systems (RRS) from a research and practical point of view. Bringing these views together, you can now fully [read my thesis online](https://kdevo.dev/#master-thesis) and [experiment with Chaos](https://github.com/kdevo/chaos-rrs), a first of its kind framework â€“ with the goal to enrich the RRS landscape with novel approaches for connecting humans.

After graduating, I have worked at [gridX](https://github.com/grid-x), a smart grid company which aims to make sustainable energy more accessible to everyone.
Recently, I travelled through South East Asia to experience the various cultures, learn and reflect from a professional and private perspective.
I am now offering software engineering services to companies that strive to have a positive impact on our world. Interested? [Drop me a message!](https://kdevo.dev/#contact)

In my free time, I am developing open-source software projects, transforming ideas to their physical representation by 3D printing, tinkering with electronic stuff [and more](https://kdevo.dev/#kd)! I love the idea behind free software and I use [Arch](https://archlinux.org/), btw.
