I am a passionate Software Engineer, Maker and Tech Enthusiast from Aachen.

In my Bachelor Thesis ([available in German-only](https://kdevo.github.io/#bachelor-thesis)), I examined how well Ethereum can be integrated into existing business processes of the [FH Aachen - University of Applied Sciences](https://www.fh-aachen.de/).

By the start of 2020, I started to extensively explore the data science field and I am fascinated by machine learning projects that improve human interaction. Currently, I am writing my Master Thesis and take a deep dive into the [emerging field of *Reciprocal Recommender Systems*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.16120) from a research and practical point of view. 

In my free time, I am developing Open-Source Software Projects, transforming ideas to their physical representation by 3D printing, working on electronic stuff [and much more](https://kdevo.github.io/#kd)! I share the vision of a democratised and decentralized Web 3.0, the idea behind free software and I am a huge Arch fan!
