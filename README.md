I am a free-minded and passionate software engineer, tech enthusiast and maker from Aachen.

In my 2018 bachelor thesis ([available in German](https://kdevo.github.io/#bachelor-thesis)), I examined how well [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) can be integrated into existing business processes of the [FH Aachen](https://www.fh-aachen.de/). 

By the start of 2020, I extensively explored the data science field and got fascinated by machine learning projects that improve human interaction.
I recently finished my master's in *Information Systems Engineering*. In my thesis, I took a deep dive into the emerging field of [*Reciprocal Recommender Systems*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.16120) from a research and practical point of view.

In my free time, I am developing open-source software projects, transforming ideas to their physical representation by 3D printing, tinkering with electronic stuff [and much more](https://kdevo.github.io/#kd)! I share the vision of a democratised and decentralized web 3.0, the idea behind free software and I am a huge Arch fan!
