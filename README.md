I am a free-minded and passionate software engineer, tech enthusiast and maker initially from Germany, based internationally and living wherever I feel good and healthy.

In [my bachelor thesis](https://kdevo.dev/#bachelor-thesis) from 2018, I examined how well [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) can be integrated into existing business processes of the [FH Aachen](https://www.fh-aachen.de/).
By the start of 2020, I extensively explored the data science field and got fascinated by machine learning projects that improve human interaction.
I completed my Master of Engineering in [Information Systems Engineering](https://fhac.de/ise) where I took a deep dive into the emerging field of Reciprocal Recommender Systems (RRS) from a research and practical point of view. Bringing these views together, you can now fully [read my thesis online](https://kdevo.dev/#master-thesis) and [experiment with Chaos](https://github.com/kdevo/chaos-rrs), a first of its kind framework â€“ with the goal to enrich the RRS landscape with novel approaches for connecting humans.

After graduating, I have worked at [gridX](https://github.com/grid-x), a smart grid company which aims to make sustainable energy more accessible to everyone.
Due to life and the changes that life brings, I decided to travel through South East Asia to experience the various cultures, learn and reflect from a professional and private perspective.
I was offering my software engineering services to companies that strive to have a positive impact on our world.

While being on a lonely island, a friend and former colleague reached out and told me about an exciting project that he's working on together with another cool dude. Together, we founded [RAZO Energy](https://www.razo.energy/). Now, we are providing the best smart charging application there is in Germany, enabling customers to flawlessly charge their EVs at the cheapest price possible (or, whenever the energy is most green ðŸ’š).

In my free time, I am developing open-source software projects, transforming ideas to their physical representation by 3D printing, tinkering with electronic stuff [and more](https://kdevo.dev/#kd)! I love the idea behind free software and I use [Arch](https://archlinux.org/), btw.
